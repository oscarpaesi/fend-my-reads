It was built as a Single-Page Application (SPA), using [React][react] and [React Router][react-router].

> This is a project assignment for [Udacity's][udacity] [Front End Web Developer Nanodegree][fend].
The base for the project was created with [Create React App][create-react-app]. It also contains icons, styles and util scripts available at [this repository][assignment-repo].
